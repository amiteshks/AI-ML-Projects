# Analyzing-User-Behavior-for-Coupon-Acceptance-Insights-and-Patterns
This project Analyzes User Behavior for Coupon Acceptance and provides Insights and Patterns.

<h1> Overview</h1>
This project analyzes coupon data to identify the characteristics of users most likely to accept a coupon code. The analysis is divided into two categories: Coupon Acceptance for Bars and Coupon Acceptance for Coffee Houses.

Observations #1: Coupon Acceptance for Bars  
1. Highest Acceptance Rate (35.91%): Drivers who:  
   Visit bars more than once a month,  
   Have passengers who are not children, and  
   Are not widowed.  
2. Second Highest Acceptance Rate (29.95%): Drivers under the age of 30 who visit bars more than once a month.  
3. Third Highest Acceptance Rate (15.23%): Drivers who:  
   Dine at cheap restaurants more than four times a month, and  
   Have an income below $50,000.  

Observations #2: Coupon Acceptance for Coffee Houses  
1. Highest Acceptance Rate (40.13%): Drivers who:  
   Visit coffee houses more than once a month,  
   Have passengers who are not children, and  
   Are not widowed.  
2. Second Highest Acceptance Rate (34.27%): Drivers under the age of 30 who visit coffee houses more than once a month.  
3. Third Highest Acceptance Rate (16.58%): Drivers who:  
   Dine at cheap restaurants more than four times a month, and
